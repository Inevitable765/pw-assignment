        "ans: predefined keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and are used to define the structure and rules of the language. These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are already used by Python to perform specific tasks. For example, keywords like if, else, and elif are used to write conditional statements, while for and while are used for loops. The keyword def is used to define a function, and class is used to define a class. Other keywords like True, False, None, import, return, and try also play important roles in different parts of a Python program. These keywords help Python understand what action the programmer wants to perform."
